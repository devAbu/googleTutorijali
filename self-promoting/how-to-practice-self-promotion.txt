1. Write out your accomplishment list - list of what makes you remarkable
2. Email friend/colleagues - Can you tell me when was the last time I did something that helped you, and what was it?....What are three things that you really value about me?
3. Create your confidence backpack - things that you have done, that you are really proud of, all of your achievements...Practice talking passionately about your skills, your talents and your past achievements
4. Try power posing - your feet firmly on the floor, and your hands on your hips
